	<h1>Nothing stays the same, ay?</h1>
	<p>After blogging with Wordpress.com for nearly 20 years, it was time to move on. Let's see...there's been iWeb, LiveJournal, Blogger, Wordpress.org...surely I've missed a service or three that I've used. It's back to Jekyll and this site is still evolving. Sometimes tech serves as a mental break from storytelling. I've archived the old blog from wp.com and some of those old posts, likely the ones folks are using for reference, will show up here.</p>
