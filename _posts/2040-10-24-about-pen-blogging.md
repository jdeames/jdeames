I love fountain pens. No way, no how, at any time am I an expert about them. I’m just a dweeb who uses a few pens. While the blog focuses on pens, sometimes ink, sometimes paper experiences, the blog also touches upon my personal journey towards consuming such things more thoughtfully.

I strive to:

    *Keep the pen collection small.
    *Use a refillable pen.
    *Repair things that break whenever possible.
    *Writing only about those subjects that I’m moved to wax on about, I don’t accept stuff for review. I like to share information and personal experience about what works for me. I don’t write reviews.

The blog represents my own experience and opinion. I’ve plenty of both, and no one compensates me for ’em.

When presenting information my intention is to be accurate and to provide a source for that information. When I cannot provide a source, or if I am providing my opinion, it shall be so stated. If you find otherwise, kindly let me know. There is an abundance of misinformation on the internet. I do not wish to create more of it.

The blog has been up since 2009 and it evolves as I write along.

From Don Miguel Ruiz’s The Four Agreements:

    *Be impeccable with your word.
    *Don’t take anything personally.
    *Don't make assumptions.
    *Always do your best.
    
These “agreements” encapsulate quite well my guiding principles in life and blog-land.

Yes, I am a writer in non-blog Life. So pens are also my tools.

Please know that articles on specific pens may get updated as more information about them is learned.

That’s what I know.

Kindness is the only rule here.

I have accepted things for review twice in the lifetime of this blog: here and here.  However,  I won’t do it again. It’s not my thing, not my interest, not my goal, not the kind of blog I intend. Kindly note I won’t respond to those tempting requests. Thanks anyway!
